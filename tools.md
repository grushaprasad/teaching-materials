---

Any tools introduced in class will be added to this website for your reference.


## Moodle
You will use [Moodle](https://moodle.colgate.edu) for assignments in this course, including submitting and receiving feedback and grades. Your instructors will also post grades for work graded elsewhere so you can use Moodle to keep track of your current grades in the course.

<!--
## Gradescope
The instructors will be using an online education tool called [gradescope](http://www.gradescope.com) to grade your **exams**. You will be able to see detailed feedback on your exams along with your scores. To register you will need a code that you will receive from your instructor in class.
-->

## InteractivePython
The **textbook** for this course, [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html) is a free, online, interactive textbook containing examples with embedded code fragments that you can run and modify. You will need to register and connect your account to your course section; details will be explained in class.


## repl.it
[repl.it](https://repl.it) is a website that we will (very likely) use for writing and running Python programs for homework problems.

## Python.org
[Python.org](https://www.python.org) is the **official website for the Python programming language**.

#### Downloading Python
Optionally, you can download **Python 3.8** directly from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This installation includes the IDLE program which is a program that you will use to write Python programs in lab. If you use a Mac, be sure to read the [special instructions](https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk) regarding installation.

#### Reference
The Python documentation [website](https://docs.python.org/3/) has loads of useful documentation. Especially useful references include the [tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/) and the [module index](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).


## Python Tutor
We will use Python Tutor's [VISUALIZE](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html) tool in lecture and lab. This tool allows you to step through the execution of python code and visualizes what is happening every step of the way. This is also a very useful tool for tracing code when you are working through homework problems or studying for exams.


<!--
## cImage Python Library
Several assignments will involve manipulating images and will require use of the cImage Python Library. You can download the module and find resources about it on our [image](image) page.

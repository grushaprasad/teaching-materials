Several assignments (labs, homeworks) in this course will involve image manipulation. The [cImage Python library](https://github.com/bnmnetp/cImage) is used in the textbook and these assignments to facilitate image manipulation. To use the library, download the following file and place it in the same folder as your Python script:

* [Image module](cImage.py)


Here are some useful resources:
